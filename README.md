#Bowie
I wanted to see if I could re-create a David Bowie Expo website that I saw. I didn't do all of it, missing the top banner and the rest of the page, because I was interested in the layout and interactions.

I liked the layout interms of the block space and I wondered how it was done and if I could mimic this. I also enjoyed the way the 'Buy Tickets' section stuck to the page once you'd scrolled past it, and that the contect faded in and scrolled up.

Here is the original website in full: <a href='https://www.acmi.net.au/exhibitions/bowie/' target='_blank'>David Bowie Expo website</a>
